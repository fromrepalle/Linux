Logical Volume Manager(LVM):-  A tool in Linux used to manage disk storage more flexibly than traditional partitioning methods. LVM allows you to create, resize, and manage disk storage dynamically without disrupting the filesystem.
Components of LVM

LVM has three key components:

Physical Volume (PV):-
A physical storage device or partition that is initialized for LVM.
Example: /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb, etc.

Volume Group (VG):-
A collection of Physical Volumes (PVs) combined into a single pool of storage.
VGs abstract the physical storage devices.

Logical Volume (LV):-
Logical partitions created within a Volume Group.
LVs are where filesystems are created (e.g., ext4, xfs).
